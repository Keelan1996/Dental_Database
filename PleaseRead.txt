Keelan Duddy database project

in the php files i've changed them to localhost and root, because I already sent
the video of them using the virtual machine and it will be turned off now.

For the patientDetails table, you can't copy from notepad++ and paste 
it right into wamp. you need to paste it from Notepad for the format to be 
correct.

I've given it here also:

create table PatientDetails (
  patientNo tinyint unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,  
  firstName varchar(45) NOT NULL, 
  lastName varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  DOB date NOT NULL,
  email varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  billAddress varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  appointmentNo tinyint unsigned NOT NULL,
  specializeIn ENUM ('Orthadontist','Periodontist','Prosthodontist') NOT NULL,
  billId tinyint unsigned NOT NULL,
  patientImage LONGBLOB DEFAULT NULL,           # Picture in DATABASE as BLOB (up to 4.2GB)
  Picture_Path varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,   # Path to where picture is stored in file system
 
  PRIMARY KEY (patientNo),
  FOREIGN KEY (appointmentNo) REFERENCES appointment(appointmentNo),
  FOREIGN KEY (billId) REFERENCES bill(billId)
  );
